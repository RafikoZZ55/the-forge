# The Forge

The Forge is a very simple project meant to show a proper way to implement **Riverpod** and **Hive** in one Flutter project.  
It was built 100% without AI and was my first serious attempt at combining Riverpod with non-primitive Hive data models.

## What's the Goal

You step into the shoes of a **blacksmith in the 15th century**.  
Your job is to build fame and earn money by repairing broken tools.  
Once you get richer, you can afford better clients and buy better forges, which are called **backgrounds**.

## How to Use It

Since I don’t have the $25 Google Play developer license, the game isn’t on the Play Store.  
If you want to play the app locally, you need to:

1. Install **Dart** and **Flutter**  
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
