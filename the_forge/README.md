## Game Concept

Step into the shoes of a **15th-century blacksmith**:

- Click to **craft and repair tools** to earn **gold**
- Buy items to **increase gold per click**
- Unlock new **cosmetic backgrounds** as you progress

The game focuses on **incremental progression** and rewards long-term play.

## Leveling System

- Earn experience by crafting and repairing tools
- Level up to **increase efficiency** and **unlock new backgrounds**
- Each level shows your growth from a humble village blacksmith to a respected craftsman

## Backgrounds

- Unlocked as you level up
- **Cosmetic only** — they don’t affect gameplay
