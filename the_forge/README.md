# the forge 
the forg is very simple project ment to show proper 
way on how you should implement riverpod and hive in one project
using flutter. 

# whats the goal
you step in the shoes of a blacksmith in XV century.
you are trying to build fame and get some money by repairing 
broken tools once you get richer you can afford better clients
and buy better forgges with are called backgrounds 

# how to use it 
since i dont have 25$ to spend on google play store for dev licence
if you want to play my game you need to install dart then flutter 
and if you finnish all the steps correctly you should be able to 
run my app

# is it worth it 
If you are learning flutter I think my app is a good blueprint 
that shows you how to work with hive and riverpod i personaly think 
that this isnt something worthy clapps but for a project made 
100% without ai and it was the first time i used riverpod and hive 
(i used hive but only to store primitive data so this was a big 
step up for me) at the same time.

# is flutter worth it 
if you are a web dev using js/ts flutter will fell familiar but not as
much as react native. If you want better performence and more structured apps
that will work on praticly any device go ith Flutter but if you want something 
easier and if you dont care about making desktop app i sugest you go with
react native
